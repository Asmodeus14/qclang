QCLang is a high-level programming language designed to bridge the gap between **classical systems programming** and **quantum circuit execution**.  
It features a Rust-inspired syntax, a strict **affine type system** for quantum safety, and compilation to **OpenQASM 2.0**.

## ✨ Features

- **Hybrid Control Flow**  
  Seamlessly mix classical logic (`if`, `for`, `while`) with quantum operations.

- **Quantum Safety (Affine Types)**  
  Compile-time enforcement of the *No-Cloning Theorem*:
  - Prevents quantum variable reassignment  
  - Prevents use-after-measurement

- **Modern, Familiar Syntax**  
  Strong typing, structs, tuples, and type aliases inspired by Rust.

- **QIR & Optimizing Backend**  
  Generates optimized **OpenQASM 2.0** (QIR phase in progress).

- **Detailed Diagnostics**  
  Helpful compile-time errors with actionable hints.

Release notes

Supported platform details

This is the recommended way to install QCLang if you don’t want to build from source.

🧪 Usage

Compile a .qc file to OpenQASM:

qclang compile my_circuit.qc --show


Run syntax checks only:

qclang check my_circuit.qc

📖 Syntax Example
Bell State Preparation
fn main() -> int {
    // Initialize quantum register
    qreg q[2] = |00>;

    // Apply gates (affine: no reassignment)
    H(q[0]);
    CNOT(q[0], q[1]);

    // Measurement consumes the qubits
    let r1: cbit = measure(q[0]);
    let r2: cbit = measure(q[1]);

    return 0;
}
