## 🧩 The Quantum Challenge

We believe that great contributors have an eye for hidden patterns. Deep within the codebase—or perhaps staring you right in the face—is a superposition of data waiting to be observed.

If you can collapse the wave function of the text below, create a file named `solution.txt` in your PR containing the deciphered phrase.
